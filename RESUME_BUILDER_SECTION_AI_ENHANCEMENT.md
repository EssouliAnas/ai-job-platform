# Resume Builder Section-Specific AI Enhancement

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of section-specific AI enhancement in the Resume Builder, replacing the global "Enhance with AI" button with targeted enhancement buttons for individual sections.

## Features Implemented

### üéØ Section-Specific Enhancement
Instead of a single global AI enhancement, users can now enhance specific sections individually:

1. **Professional Summary** - Enhances the personal summary with compelling, professional language
2. **Work Experience Description** - Improves each experience description with action verbs and quantifiable achievements
3. **Education Description** - Enhances education descriptions with relevant coursework and achievements
4. **Skills Overview** - Improves the skills overview with professional language and comprehensive coverage

### üîß Technical Implementation

#### New API Endpoint: `/api/enhance-section`
- **Purpose**: Handles section-specific AI enhancement requests
- **Model**: Uses GPT-4 for high-quality, natural enhancements
- **Input**: Section type, content, and contextual information
- **Output**: Enhanced content tailored to the specific section

#### Enhanced User Interface
- **Individual Buttons**: Each section now has its own "Enhance with AI" button
- **Conditional Display**: Buttons only appear when there's content to enhance
- **Loading States**: Section-specific loading indicators during enhancement
- **Immediate Application**: Enhanced content replaces the original text directly in the form

### üîÑ Workflow Changes

#### Before (Global Enhancement)
1. Complete all sections (Personal Info, Experience, Education, Skills)
2. Click global "Enhance with AI" button
3. Review suggestions in modal
4. Apply all suggestions at once

#### After (Section-Specific Enhancement)
1. Enter content in any section
2. Click "Enhance with AI" next to that section
3. Enhanced content immediately replaces original text
4. Continue with other sections as needed

### üõ†Ô∏è Code Structure

#### State Management
```typescript
// Section-specific enhancement states
const [enhancingSection, setEnhancingSection] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [enhancingExperienceId, setEnhancingExperienceId] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [enhancingEducationId, setEnhancingEducationId] = useState<string | null>(null);
```

#### Enhancement Functions
- `enhanceSummary()` - Enhances professional summary
- `enhanceExperience(experienceId)` - Enhances specific experience entry
- `enhanceEducation(educationId)` - Enhances specific education entry
- `enhanceSkillsOverview()` - Enhances skills overview

#### API Integration
```typescript
const response = await fetch('/api/enhance-section', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    section: 'summary', // or 'experience', 'education', 'skills'
    content: currentContent,
    context: relevantContext
  }),
});
```
