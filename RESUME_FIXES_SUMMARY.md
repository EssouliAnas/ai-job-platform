# Resume Viewing and Selection Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Company Side - Resume Viewing Error
**Problem**: Companies were getting "Resume not found" errors when trying to view applicant resumes.

**Root Cause**: The resume API endpoint (`/api/resumes/[id]/route.ts`) only allowed users to view their own resumes with the constraint `.eq('user_id', session.user.id)`.

**Solution**:
- Modified the resume API to detect company users and allow them to access resumes through job applications
- Added a `download=true` query parameter to generate and return DOCX files directly
- Updated company dashboard links to use download URLs instead of trying to view resumes inline
- Companies can now download resumes as DOCX files directly from the application lists

**Files Changed**:
- `app/api/resumes/[id]/route.ts` - Enhanced to handle company access and DOCX downloads
- `app/company/jobs/[id]/page.tsx` - Changed "View Resume" to "Download Resume" with download parameter
- `app/company/applications/page.tsx` - Updated resume links to use download functionality

### 2. Candidate Side - Resume Selection for Job Applications
**Problem**: Candidates couldn't select which resume to use when applying for jobs - the system automatically used their latest resume.

**Solution**:
- Created a new `ResumeSelector` component that displays all user resumes in a modal
- Enhanced the job application API to accept a `resumeId` parameter
- Updated both dashboard and individual job pages to show resume selection before applying
- Added resume metadata display (skills, experience count, creation dates) to help users choose

**Files Changed**:
- `app/components/ResumeSelector.tsx` - New component for resume selection
- `app/api/apply-job/route.ts` - Enhanced to handle specific resume selection
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Integrated resume selector into application flow
- `app/jobs/[id]/page.tsx` - Added resume selection to individual job applications

## Key Features Added

### Resume Selector Component
- Displays all user resumes with metadata (name, email, skills count, etc.)
- Shows resume creation and update dates
- Displays top skills for each resume
- Radio button selection interface
- Prevents application without resume selection
- Links to resume builder if no resumes exist

### Company Resume Downloads
- Direct DOCX download links instead of inline viewing
- Proper access control through job applications
- Uses existing DOCX generation API
- Maintains security by only allowing access to resumes from applicants to company jobs

### Enhanced Application Flow
- Resume selection is now mandatory for all job applications
- Users can see which resume they're applying with
- Better user experience with clear resume identification
- Prevents accidental applications with wrong resumes

## Security Considerations

- Company users can only access resumes from candidates who applied to their company's jobs
- Individual users can only access their own resumes
- Resume downloads are generated server-side using existing DOCX generation
- All access is validated through proper database relationships

## User Experience Improvements

- Clear resume selection process with visual feedback
- Resume metadata helps users choose the right resume for each job
- Download functionality is more reliable than inline viewing
- Better error handling and user feedback throughout the process

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test company resume downloads from job applications
2. Verify resume selector appears when applying to jobs
3. Confirm only user's own resumes appear in selector
4. Test application flow with different resume selections
5. Verify security - companies can't access arbitrary resumes
6. Test error handling when no resumes exist
